# ReactFullStackAuth

An example of full-stack authorization and security practices built using React, PostgreSQL and Node. The frontend content is taken from my [ReactOAuth project](https://github.com/sleeplesseditor/ReactOAuth).

The app uses the SHA256 algorithm to encrypt user login details.

To get the app up and running, follow these steps:

1) cd ReactFullStackAuth
2) cd backend, then npm install
3) cd ../../ReactFullStackAuth
4) cd frontend, then npm install

The backend is started with 'npm run dev', and the frontend is started with 'npm start'.
